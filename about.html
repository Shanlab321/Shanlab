  <p><strong>Zeshan Ahmed</strong><br>
  Founder of SHAN Academy of Quantum Simulation & Materials (𝙎𝘼𝙌𝙎𝙈)</p>

  <p>I am a passionate young researcher with strong expertise in <strong>Density Functional Theory (DFT)</strong> and <strong>Molecular Dynamics (MD)</strong> simulations. I hold a <strong>Master of Philosophy (MPhil)</strong> degree in Physics with a specialization in <strong>Material Science</strong> from the <strong>Department of Physics, Kohat University of Science and Technology (KUST), Pakistan</strong>.</p>

  <p>My research involves using advanced computational methods to investigate the fundamental behavior and characteristics of materials at the atomic and molecular levels. I focus on applying modern simulation techniques to explore material performance for applications in electronics, energy, and nanotechnology.</p>

  <p>I have professional command of simulation tools within <strong>Materials Studio</strong>, including: <br>
  <em>CASTEP, DMol³, Forcite, GULP, Reflex, Amorphous Cell, Morphology, Polymer Builder, Adsorption Locator, and MSI2LMP</em>.</p>

  <p>Through SAQSM and my YouTube channel, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/@MaterialsStudioZone" target="_blank">@MaterialsStudioZone</a>, I aim to support students and early-career researchers by sharing practical training, tutorials, and real research guidance in computational materials science.</p>
