      <p><strong>SHAN Academy of Quantum Simulation & Materials (𝙎𝘼𝙌𝙎𝙈)</strong> is a virtual lab founded to promote hands-on learning and research in computational materials science. The lab focuses on using advanced simulation methods such as <strong>Density Functional Theory (DFT)</strong> and <strong>Molecular Dynamics (MD)</strong> to explore and understand materials at the atomic level.</p>

      <p>SAQSM is designed to help students, researchers, and early-career scientists gain real-world skills in tools like <strong>CASTEP</strong>, <strong>DMol³</strong>, and <strong>Materials Studio</strong>, even if they do not have access to physical laboratories or advanced infrastructure.</p>

      <p>The mission of the lab is to create a collaborative, knowledge-sharing platform where learners from across the world can engage in training, research, and innovation. Whether you’re working on a thesis, publishing papers, or learning simulations for the first time — SAQSM offers the guidance, tools, and inspiration to support your journey.</p>

      <p><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> When the perfect time comes, SHAN Academy will evolve from a virtual space into a real physical lab — a center where students and researchers can meet, collaborate, and advance materials science together.</p>
