        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>My research is rooted in the computational modeling of advanced materials, with a focus on Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. I use tools such as CASTEP, DMol³, and Forcite to explore the electronic, optical, thermal, and adsorptive behavior of functional materials. My long-term vision is to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental realities, while empowering students and early-career researchers through SHAN Academy.</p>
